# Elemental Style Guide

Generate a cross-platform style guide from a JSON theme based on our schema.

Planned targets are: Sketch and web.

## In Development

A working version of the Sketch style guide export already exists for this, but needs to be abstracted into a form in which it can be open-sourced.

Please star/watch this repo and check back later!
